# Word-Sense-Disambiguation
## Introduction
There are many words in our day-to-day life which have similar spelling with different meaning. For example, word ‘cold’ represents two meaning, one is ‘absent of heat’ while second is mostly used during winter for nose blocking. The problem of determining the context for given target word from the sentence is called word sense disambiguation in Natural language processing (NLP).In this repo, we are using support vector machine (SVM) technique to classify various context. We used ‘SENSEVAL’ dataset to train the SVM classifier. This dataset offer corpus for four different words: line, interest, hard and serve. We trained SVM for ‘line’ word for different parameters and come up with best parameter that can classify the context with highest accuracy.
