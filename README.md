# Word-Sense-Disambiguation
## Goal
Find context of given target word from the sentence.
## Introduction
We are using support vector machine (SVM) technique to classify various context of given target word.
We used ‘SENSEVAL’ dataset to train the SVM classifier. This dataset offer corpus for four
different words: line, interest, hard and serve. We trained SVM for ‘line’ word for different
parameters and come up with best parameter that can classify the context with highest accuracy.
